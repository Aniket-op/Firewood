# Firewood
A simple and easy-to-use video calling website

## Description

The project is essentially a very minimal and easy-to-use video calling website,
wherein users can create cabins and invite other users to them.

The site has a variety of error correction methods and quality-of-life features such as:
- Password validation
- User validation
- Cookie validation
- Reset password (Forgot password)

### The Basic Premise
Users sign up for an account with a Username, E-mail, and a Password, and can create
new cabins.

The cabin pages require you to be logged in to access them and will redirect you back to the '/' route if you are not logged in.
